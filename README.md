Project for Codecademy: Freelance Web Dev

Created by Brian Kearney from design spec. Used concepts taught in box model and flex model lessons.

Git was not part of the project instructions so I did not use it during development. I'll assume from now on I need to use git as part of my regular workflow. As a result for this project though, there is only one commit...the final one.
